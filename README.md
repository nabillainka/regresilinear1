## 🔍 **Introduction**
Among the various experiences I had during my Field Work Practice (PKL), this project was the most memorable conclusion. This final project was born from the learning process, the challenges faced, and the notes collected throughout the PKL. In between writing reports and chasing deadlines, the draft of this project slowly took shape. After being neatly stored with the PKL report archives, I am now bringing it back to share. It would be a shame if the experiences and lessons learned were to remain confined to the report alone. Therefore, I am open to feedback and corrections so that this project can continue to be refined and provide mutual benefits.

## 🔍 **Background**
The population of Bekasi City has increased significantly over the years. In 2022, the population of Bekasi City reached 2,590,257, an increase of 25,316 compared to the previous year. Bekasi City has an area of approximately 210.5 km², which is divided into 12 sub-districts, so that the increase in population has a direct impact on population density and the need for public facilities.

Forecasting the population is very important so that the government can make the right policies. With predictions of the future population, the government can:
- Identify potential problems such as traffic congestion, overcrowded settlements, clean water needs, health, education, and infrastructure.
- Determine more optimal development and public service strategies.
- Take advantage of opportunities in the fields of economy, investment, and spatial planning.

Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and forecast the population of Bekasi City for the coming years so that development planning can be carried out effectively and on target.

## 🔍 **Research Questions and Objectives**
### Research Questions
- What are the trends in the population of Bekasi City from 2008 to 2023?
- What are the results of population forecasting for 2024–2026 using the Brown method?
- How accurate are these forecasts?

### Research Objectives
- To determine the trend in population change in Bekasi City from 2008 to 2023.
- To forecast the population for the following years using the DES method.
- To analyze the accuracy of the forecast using MAPE.

### Scope of the Problem
- The data used only comes from the Bekasi City Statistics Agency in the publication “Kota Bekasi dalam Angka” (Bekasi City in Figures).
- The data period used is 2008–2023.
- The variable analyzed is only the population, not including socio-economic factors such as migration, birth rates, mortality rates, education, or infrastructure.
- The forecasting method used is Brown's Double Exponential Smoothing, without comparing it to other methods such as ARIMA, Moving Average, or Linear Trend.
- Data processing and calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel software.

## 🔍 **Conclusion and Recommendations**
### Conclusion
**1. The Effect of HDI on Poverty**
- HDI has a negative and significant effect on poverty levels.
- The higher the HDI → the lower the poverty rate.

**2. The Effect of Population Size on Poverty**
- Population size has a negative but very small effect.
- Population growth does not significantly increase poverty.

**3. Simultaneous Effect of HDI & Population Size**
- HDI and population size have a simultaneous significant effect.
- Strong regression model (R² = 0.8976): 89.76% of poverty variation is explained by both variables.


### Recommendations
**1. Improving Human Development Index (HDI)**
- The government needs to strengthen the education, health, and economic sectors because improving HDI has been proven to reduce poverty.
- Focus on job skills training and access to education for low-income communities.

**2. Population Growth Management**
- Control and plan population growth through the equitable distribution of facilities and jobs.
- Expand employment opportunities for the productive age population to maintain economic stability.

**3. Poverty Alleviation Policy**
- Social assistance and community empowerment programs must be targeted according to the latest data.
- Encourage the development of MSMEs and the creative economy to increase income.
  
**4. Further Research**
- Use additional variables such as unemployment, GRDP, and inflation for more comprehensive analysis results.
- More detailed annual data collection is needed to improve model accuracy.
